# Vector search

OpenSearch is a comprehensive search platform that supports a variety of data types, including vectors. OpenSearch vector database functionality is seamlessly integrated with its generic database function.

In OpenSearch, you can generate vector embeddings, store those embeddings in an index, and use them for vector search.

## Bring your own vectors

If youâ€™ve already generated your own vector embeddings, OpenSearch makes it easy to ingest and search them. Follow this documentation sequence to get started:

{% include list.html list_items=page.raw_steps%}

## Seamless text-to-embedding search

Simplify your search process by letting OpenSearch handle embedding generation. Follow this documentation sequence to begin using text-to-embedding search:
