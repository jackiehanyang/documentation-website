# Getting started with vector search

Vector search, also known as similarity search or nearest neighbor search, is a powerful technique for finding items that are most similar to a given input. Unlike traditional search methods that rely on exact keyword matches, vector search uses _vector embeddings_â€”--numerical representations of data such as text, images, or audio. These embeddings are transformed into multi-dimensional vectors, capturing deeper patterns and similarities in meaning, context, or structure.

Use cases include semantic search to understand user intent, recommendations (for example, an "other songs you might like" feature in a music application), image recognition, and fraud detection. For more background information about vector search, see [Nearest neighbor search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search).

## Vector search options

OpenSearch offers two options for implementing vector search:

- [Pre-generated embeddings or raw vectors](#option-1-pre-generated-embeddings): You already have pre-computed embeddings or raw vectors from external tools or services.
  - **Ingestion**: Ingest pre-generated embeddings directly into OpenSearch.

  - **Search**: Perform vector search to find the vectors that are closest to a query vector.

- [Auto-generated embeddings](#option-2-auto-generated-embeddings): OpenSearch automatically generates vector embeddings for you using a machine learning (ML) model.
  - **Ingestion**:  You ingest plain text data, and OpenSearch uses an ML model to generate embeddings dynamically.

  - **Search**: At query time, OpenSearch uses the same ML model to convert your input text to embeddings, and these embeddings are used for vector search.
