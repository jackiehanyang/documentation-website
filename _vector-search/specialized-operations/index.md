# Specialized vector search

OpenSearch supports the following specialized vector search applications. 

## Vector search with filters

## Nested field vector search

For information about vector search with nested fields, see [Vector search with filters]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/knn/nested-search-knn/).

## Radial search

With radial search, you can search all points within a vector space that reside within a specified maximum distance or minimum score threshold from a query point. For information about vector search with nested fields, see [Radial search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/knn/radial-search-knn/).
